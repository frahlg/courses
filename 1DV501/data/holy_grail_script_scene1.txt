KING ARTHUR:  Whoa there!
    [clop clop clop]
SOLDIER #1:  Halt!  Who goes there?
ARTHUR:  It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.
    King of the Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!
SOLDIER #1:  Pull the other one!
ARTHUR:  I am,... and this is my trusty servant Patsy.  We have ridden the 
    length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join me in my 
    court at Camelot.  I must speak with your lord and master.
SOLDIER #1:  What?  Ridden on a horse?
ARTHUR:  Yes!
SOLDIER #1:  You're using coconuts!
ARTHUR:  What?
SOLDIER #1:  You've got two empty halves of coconut and you're bangin' 'em 
    together.
ARTHUR:  So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, 
    through the kingdom of Mercea, through--
SOLDIER #1:  Where'd you get the coconuts?
ARTHUR:  We found them.
SOLDIER #1:  Found them?  In Mercea?  The coconut's tropical!
ARTHUR:  What do you mean?
SOLDIER #1:  Well, this is a temperate zone.
ARTHUR:  The swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin or the 
    plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to
    our land?
SOLDIER #1:  Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
ARTHUR:  Not at all.  They could be carried.
